# 📊 Excel Sales Dashboard Project

## 🗂️ Project Overview
This project presents an interactive **Sales Executive Dashboard** built using Microsoft Excel. It showcases how to analyze transactional data for **sales and profit trends**, **regional performance**, and **product sub-category analysis** — enabling better business decisions through data visualization.

## 💼 Use Case
Designed for business stakeholders who want to:
- Track year-over-year sales and profit performance
- Compare profit contribution by U.S. state and product category
- Identify high-performing vs. underperforming regions and products
- Explore data across different quarters using interactive filters

---

## 🧾 Dataset Summary
The dataset (in the Excel file) includes:
- **Order details**: sales, profit, category, region, segment, date
- **Timeline**: Monthly data comparison between 2022 and 2023
- **Geography**: U.S. states
- **Sub-Categories**: Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies

---

## 📈 Dashboard Insights

### 🔹 Total Sales & Profit (Top KPIs)
- **Sales**: $2.40M ↑ *12.38% vs previous year*
- **Profit**: $301.24K ↑ *0.23% vs previous year*

Growth in revenue is strong, but profit remains flat — suggesting opportunities for **cost reduction** or **pricing review**.

---

### 🔹 Monthly Trends
Line charts compare monthly performance for:
- **Sales**: Peak in **November ($207K)**  
- **Profit**: Gradual increase toward **year-end**, peaking at **$28K in December**

This reveals **seasonal patterns**, useful for forecasting.

---

### 🔹 Ship Mode Distribution
- **Standard Class:** 60%
- **Second Class:** 19%
- **First Class:** 15%
- **Same Day:** 6%

Majority of deliveries favor cost-efficiency (Standard Class), while faster delivery modes are minimal.

---

### 🔹 Profit by States (Map & Bar Charts)
- **Top States by Profit**:  
  - California: $83.16K  
  - New York: $76.31K  
- **Texas** showed negative profit: -$26.27K despite 1,016 transactions.

🔍 Insight: High transaction volume ≠ high profit. Operations in Texas may need optimization.

---

### 🔹 Product Sub-Category Sales
- **Top Performers**: Phones, Binders, Chairs, Storage
- **Underperformers**: Tables, Accessories, Fasteners, Copiers

This helps identify which products to **promote**, **optimize**, or **phase out**.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

1. **Investigate Low Profit Margins**  
   Despite increased sales, profit grew marginally. Review pricing strategy, discounts, or operational costs.

2. **Focus on High-Margin Products**  
   Promote *Binders*, *Chairs*, and *Phones* more aggressively due to strong performance.

3. **Reassess Underperforming Sub-Categories**  
   Fasteners and Copiers should be reviewed for pricing, demand, or inventory inefficiencies.

4. **Texas Market Audit**  
   Texas had high transactions but negative profit. Investigate shipping, discounting, or customer behavior in this region.

5. **Promote Cost-Effective Ship Modes**  
   Since most customers use Standard Class, explore ways to optimize or upsell to Second Class and First Class for better profitability.
